 * REQUEST_TEAM_STATE
 *
 * Requests team state from the server, which will pass on the request to any connected teammates, or send the last
 * known state if no teammates are connected.

 * This fires when loading into a file while Anchor is connected, or when Anchor is connected while a file is already
 * loaded
 *
 * Note: This can additionally be fired with a button in the menus to fix any desyncs that may have occurred in the save
 * state
